# Knee OA Classification Using Bone Distance

* Applying computer vision algorithms and machine learning models to design a computer-aided diagnosis system

## Introduction:

* Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis. The severity of knee OA is measured by Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grades. 
* The KL scale is a 5-point grading system that ranges from 0 to 4, with higher numbers indicating more severe OA. In a binary classification system, cases with KL 0-2 are considered as non-OA cases, while cases with KL 3-4 are considered as OA.

* Cartilage is the slippery tissue on the ends of bones, in between joints, and elsewhere in the body. The thickness of cartilage is an important biomarker to access the severity of knee OA. 
* Cartilage can be measured directly in medical images, but it is difficult and time-consuming. An indirect but efficient way is to segment the bones first, and measure the distance between femur and tibia bones, as an alternate measurement for the cartilage.
